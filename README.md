## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an indie game developer from Richmond, British Columbia. I graduated with a Masters Degree in Finance, but changed to game development because games are a lifelong passion of mine.

I've been making games for several years and self-publishing games under the studio ShenTzu Games a few in this time, primarily narrative driven games with RPG Maker MV. Now I'm continuing my game dev journey with Godot, and looking for a job in the industry! While Iâ€™m primarily a generalist, my specialty and passion is worldbuilding and narrative design.

You can find my published games on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/ShenTzuGames), and my game jams and prototypes on [itch.io](https://shentzu.itch.io)! You can also reach me at shentzugames@yahoo.com!

Currently working on an undisclosed cozy point and click adventure game using GDScript!
